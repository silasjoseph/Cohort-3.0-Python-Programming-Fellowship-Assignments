My Journey with Arewa Data Science Fellowship"
As I gazed out the window, lost in thought, my mind wandered through the rollercoaster of emotions that had defined my life. The pain of losing my mother to cancer still lingered, a constant reminder of the darkness that once consumed me.
After her passing, my world crumbled. My father, overwhelmed by grief, became a shadow of himself, and I struggled to find meaning in a world without my guiding light. School became a challenge, relationships suffered, and self-doubt crept in.
But life had other plans.
A destiny helper emerged, offering psychological and emotional support. My father, too, found strength, becoming a pillar of support. With renewed purpose, I dove into my studies, discovering solace in research and computation.
Upon graduating in December 2018, my quest for knowledge intensified. I sought to deepen my understanding of computers, and that's when I met a fellow who introduced me to Arewa Data Science.
He promised to notify me when applications opened, and he kept his word. I applied, and to my delight, I was accepted.
Here I am, surrounded by like-minded individuals, learning with enthusiasm and zeal. My journey with Arewa Data Science has just begun, and I'm excited to share my experiences and newfound knowledge.
I never knew computing is so amazing and intresting until my recent discovery with Arewa Data Science Fellowship.
Stay tuned as I'll reveal the skills and insights I've gained.
